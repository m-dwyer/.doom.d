# .doom.d
A very non-literate doom emacs config

## What?

My doom dotfiles, for my custom [doom-emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs) configuration

## How?

    git clone https://github.com/m-dwyer/.doom.d.git ~/.doom.d/

I use org-mode heavily as a productivity system / second brain / PKM, so you'll probably want those files, too (coming shortly!)

## Why?

After going down rabbit holes developing my own emacs from scratch configuration thanks largely to the [System Crafters](https://www.youtube.com/c/SystemCrafters) series of the same name,  I decided to move to doom emacs for its sensible default that get out of the way, enabling me to focus on what matters.

My doom config provides config for logging and tracking projects, tasks, scheduling, reviews, journalling, etc.  I'm also building it out for development.
You will need this config (or at least part of it) if you wish to follow the productivity system I'm using.

Or feel free to take parts that look interesting & useful, and integrate them into your own setup.

Feedback, thoughts, recommendations much appreciated!
